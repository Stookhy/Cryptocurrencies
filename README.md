# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the Analysis
  1.  Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
  2.  Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
  3.  Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
  4.  Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
  5.  Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
