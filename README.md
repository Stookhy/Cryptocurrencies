# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the Analysis
  1.  Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
  2.  Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
  3.  Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
  4.  Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
  5.  Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

## Purpose 

  Using unsupervised machine learning to process data by grouping cyrptocurrencies on a clustering algorithm. The data process includes the null values are handled, only numerical data is used, and the values are scaled to ensure the variance between the numbers won't skew the reults.
